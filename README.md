A calculator which does Euler's method that I made for fun.

Currently it only accepts x and y values for first order differential equations.

It will draw a plot to plot.png and create result.txt with the raw numerical values.

The release can be found here: https://github.com/catocatocat0/Eulers-Method-Calculator/releases/tag/1

Run Start.bat or select the directory where the .jar is located and run this command: java -jar Euler.jar
